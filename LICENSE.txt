At the end of the evaluation period, you should decide whether you want to keep the Software.  You must purchase a Registration Key if you want to continue using the Software after the evaluation period ends.  If you decide for any reason that you do not want to purchase a Registration Key, you must stop using the Software and remove it from your computer.

3. RESTRICTIONS.  You may not reverse engineer, de-compile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.  You may not use the SOFTWARE in a military domain; in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of weapons.    You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE.  You may permanently transfer all of your rights under this EULA, provided the recipient agrees to the terms of this EULA.

8. LIMITED WARRANTY.  Andy Goryachev warrants that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of 90 days from the date of your receipt of the Software.  Any implied warranties on the Software are limited to 90 days.  Some states do not allow limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

IN ANY EVENT, ANDY GORYACHEV'S LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY YOU.
